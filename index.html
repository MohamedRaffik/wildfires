              Wildfires, often called forest fires, damage thousands of acres of natural resources most every year in New York. Although wildfires naturally occur from
              lightning, most are caused by human activities. To protect our natural resources and communities from wildfire damage, residents, visitors and municipal
              jurisdictions must contribute to wildfire prevention and fire containment.

              Three major wildfires – Camp, Woolsey, and Hill – have engulfed the state of California. Camp Fire, in the northern part of the state, has destroyed more than 
              6,700 structures and killed at least 29 people, making it California's most destructive wildfire and third deadliest in history. The blaze also consumed most 
              of Paradise, a town north of Sacramento. In Southern California, firefighters estimate that more than the 300,000 people have been forced to evacuate from their 
              homes because of the Woolsey and Hill fires. As the wildfires continue to rage, those looking to help can support those suffering from the devastation in a number 
              of ways.
